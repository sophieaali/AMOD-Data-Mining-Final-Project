# AMOD-Data-Mining-Final-Project
The dataset chosen for this analysis is the Forest Fires Data Set from Kaggle.

As a group, we started out with some basic data exploration, then we cleaned the data (including identifying and removing outliers), then we used multiple statistical methods to analyze the data. 
The three outlier detection methods we used were Z-score, Isolation forest, and Elliptic Envelope.
The methods used to analyze the data was a Linear Regression, and Random Forest Regressor and k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers. A copy of our full report can be found in ‘Write-up’.
